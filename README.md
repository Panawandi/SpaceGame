During my computer science degree, I completed a module on Programming with Games, where we were tasked with developing a 2D game using Java.
The game featured a spaceship controlled by the arrow keys (left, right, down, and up) and a shooting mechanism activated by the space key.
Set in space, the game revolved around eliminating virus particles representing COVID-19.

Key functionalities included:

A timer that reset the level if the player lost or advanced to level 2 if successful.
A point system that awarded 100 points for each virus destroyed and deducted 50 points if the player was hit.
A life system where the game ended if the player lost all their lives.
